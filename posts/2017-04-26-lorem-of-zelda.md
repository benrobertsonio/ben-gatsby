For fun, I made a [Legend of Zelda lorem ipsum / placeholder text generator](http://loremofzelda.com).

I had a project that had zero content going into development and so had I fun generating content like this:

It isn't fancy, but personally I think it's a lot of fun to use. The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/benjamingrobertson/loremofzelda). I've got some text that I loop through at random to pull the quotes. Currently I've only got Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past, Wind Waker, Ocarina of Time, and Majora's Mask. If you'd like to see more quotes added, feel free to send them to me or open a pull request!

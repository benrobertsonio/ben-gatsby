## Getting Started with Web Accessibility

There are lots of different ways to get started with accessibility, and honestly, looking at a list like what I've compiled here might be more overwhelming than it needs to be. I think getting started with web accessibility can be boiled down into [four simple principles](/accessibility/principles-getting-started-website-accessibility), but depending on how you like to learn you may find one or more of these resources helpful. I've certainly consulted them over the years!

### [A11y Coffee](https://a11y.coffee/)

Amberley Romo wanted a single place to be able to point people to answer the question, "what is web accessibility and how do I get started?". She built [a11y.coffee](https://a11y.coffee) to answer it.

### How to use a screen reader

The Paciello Group has a really helpful [quick start guide for screen readers](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2015/01/basic-screen-reader-commands-for-accessibility-testing/) including JAWS, Narrator, NVDA and VoiceOver.

When people ask me how to get started using a screen reader on macOS, I send them this guide from Bocoup: [Getting Started with VoiceOver & Accessibility](https://bocoup.com/blog/getting-started-with-voiceover-accessibility).

## Books

Sometimes I find books a helpful way to focus on a topic and cut out a lot of noise. Reading one person's longer perspective on a topic can often be more efficient than reading a bunch of isolated blog posts and cobbling them together. Here are some great books about web accessibility.

### [Accessibility for Everyone](https://abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-everyone) by Laura Kalbag

This is a great overview of the web accessibility landscape. You'll learn about disabilities and impairments, how to plan for accessibility, content and design considerations, HTML and accessibility, testing, and relevant laws and guidelines.

If you want one book intro to the field, I suggest this one.

### [Inclusive Components](http://book.inclusive-components.design/) by Heydon Pickering

### [Inclusive Design Patterns](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/products/inclusive-design-patterns)

### [Resilient Web Design](https://resilientwebdesign.com/) by Jeremy Keith

This is more of a history book of the web than a set of tutorials, but in it Jeremy Keith provides so much helpful context for understanding why websites are built in certain ways and not in others, and longer term ideas to follow to build websites that are *resilient*.

> You won’t find any code in here to help you build better websites. But you will find ideas and approaches. Ideas are more resilient than code. I’ve tried to combine the most resilient ideas from the history of web design into an approach for building the websites of the future.

> This book explains how we can craft accessible interfaces without extra effort — and what front-end design patterns we can use to create inclusive experiences.

## Keeping up to date

### [A11y Weekly](https://a11yweekly.com/)

The [A11y Weekly](https://a11yweekly.com/) newsletter, curated by David A. Kennedy, is a great resource for staying connected on what's happening on a weekly basis in the web accessibility community.

The format is usually:

- another featured article

Automated testing is really helpful both for learning about accessibility and making sure the sites you build are accessibile. Automated testing won't catch all issues, but is well-worth the effort to set up!

# About these Notes

A collection of notes.

I've recently moved all of my [[Drafts]] here - blog posts I started to write, am working on, or will never finish. Maybe they'll end up on the [blog](/blog), maybe they won't!

Some of the most common topics are:

- [[Accessibility]]
- [[Code]]
- [[Gatsby]]
- [[Drafts]]
- [[Career]]
- [[Writing]]

[Code]: code "Code"
[Career]: career "Career"

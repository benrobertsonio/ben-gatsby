# Software Engineering Management Books

These are the books I've been reading this year that have helped me get a grasp on engineering management.

## [[Radical Candor]]

[Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Candor-Revised-Kick-Ass-Humanity-ebook/dp/B07P9LPXPT/)

I held off on reading this book for a long time because of a bad work experience of "candor", but I've spent a lot of time with the book this year and it helped a lot to guide the initial conversations I had with new engineers as they joined the team.

## [[Scrum]]

[Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I52D6KQ/.)

The title is a little bit cheesy, but I wish I read this book a long time ago.

## [[The Manager's Path]]

[The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change](https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth-ebook/dp/B06XP3GJ7F/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3ABLOWLSF4E22&dchild=1&keywords=the+manager%27s+path&qid=1599668433&s=digital-text&sprefix=the+manager%27s+%2Cdigital-text%2C155&sr=1-1)

This was recommended to me at a previous job to get a better feel of what it means to be a technical lead, and overall was helpful for me understanding different roles and responsibilities in software.

Perhaps this is embarrassing, but I didn't really have a concept of Individual Contributor vs Management before reading this book.

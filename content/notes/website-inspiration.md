I love the footnotes on this site: https://jeffrafter.com/gatsby-with-typescript/. Plus I love that he is using the Edward Tufte fonts ðŸ¥°.

My coworker [Josh Comeau's](https://joshwcomeau.com/) site is simply wonderful.

I like what [Aravind Balla](http://notes.aravindballa.com/) has done with his notes! Especially the preview for linked references - I'd like to figure out how they've done that.

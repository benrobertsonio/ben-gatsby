> preload is a declarative fetch, allowing you to force the browser to make a request for a resource without blocking the documentâ€™s onload event.

> Prefetch is a hint to the browser that a resource might be needed, but delegates deciding whether and when loading it is a good idea or not to the browser.

> When should you `<link rel="preload">` vs `<link rel="prefetch">`?
> Tip: Preload resources you have high-confidence will be used in the current page. Prefetch resources likely to be used for future navigations across multiple navigation boundaries.

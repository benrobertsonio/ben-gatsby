Want to learn how to incorporate a component-driven development workflow in your Drupal project? Join the Mediacurrent team for a full-day workshop at DrupalCon Nashville on [Component Based Development using UI Patterns](https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/training/component-based-development-using-uipatterns)!

Component driven development is a hot topic right now, and for good reason. A component based approach lends itself to a more modularized front end, more efficient development cycles, a consistent UI, and a smoother developer experience on both the front end and integration processes.

With the [UI Patterns](http://drupal.org/project/ui_patterns) module in Drupal, you can achieve the benefits of a component-driven workflow in Drupal 8 and the design system [holy grail](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-5/#in-search-of-the-holy-grail):

> The design system holy grail involves creating an environment where the pattern library and live applications are perfectly in sync. The idea is that you should be able to make a change to a UI pattern and see that change automatically reflected in both the pattern library and anywhere the pattern is included in production.
> <br/><i><small>Brad Frost, Atomic Design</small></i>

Beyond that, a UI Patterns-based workflow also provides:

 - A living style guide built into Drupal
 - Self-contained portable patterns that can be used in any project
 - Smoother front end integration

## What We'll Cover

Our full day workshop will start with an overview of component-driven development, typical workflows, and benefits for teams and stakeholders, and then we'll dive deep into the workflow by building out a sample Drupal theme using the UI Patterns approach. We'll cover:

 - An in-depth look at creating patterns including markup, styles, and behaviors
 - Composing complex UI patterns by nesting simple patterns in larger patterns
 - Integrating front-end patterns with Drupal using the UI Patterns module to simplify the process and preserve Drupal's baked in goodies
 - Advanced workflows with Sass, a Drupal 8 theme generator, incorporating ES6/Babel with patterns

## Who's involved
The workshop will be led by several of our front-end developers here at Mediacurrent:

 - Mario Hernandez, Senior Front End Developer
 - Eric Huffman, Senior Front End Developer
 - Ben Robertson, Front End Developer

And we will be joined by Chaz Chumley, Technology Manager at [Forum One](https://forumone.com/).

The workshop will take place on Monday, April 9, 2018, from 9:00 am to 5:00pm. The cost of the training is $500 in addition to your DrupalCon ticket, so register now to snag the early bird discount!
